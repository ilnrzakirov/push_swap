<br>• The game is composed of 2 stacks named a and b.</br>
<br>• To start with:</br>
<br>◦ the stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers
which cannot be duplicated.</br>
<br>◦ b is empty</br>
<br>• The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a.</br>
<br>• To do this you have the following operations at your disposal:</br>
<br></br>
<br>sa : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there
is only one or no elements).</br>
<br>sb : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there
is only one or no elements).</br>
<br>ss : sa and sb at the same time.</br>
<br>pa : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do
nothing if b is empty.</br>
<br>pb : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do
nothing if a is empty.</br>
<br>ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes
the last one.</br>
<br>rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes
the last one.</br>
<br>rr : ra and rb at the same time.</br>
<br>rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element
becomes the first one.</br>
<br>rrb : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element
becomes the first one.</br>
<br>rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.</br>
